## Rich Test Results Snapshot

I was working on my website and got this error when testing structured data.  
When this happens, a good thing to do is go to the **Rich Results Test**.  

The Rich Results Test is a site made by **Google**. Itâ€™s free to use and checks whether your structured data (schema markup) is valid and eligible for rich results in search.  
ðŸ‘‰ [Try it here](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)  

This repo includes snapshots from that tool to help document test outcomes, including:  
- **rich-test-results.png** â€“ example of the error message  
- **local-business.png** â€“ example of testing local business schema
