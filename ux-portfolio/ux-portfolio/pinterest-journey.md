## Process and Contributions

**Problem Discovery**  
Analytics showed that many Pinterest visitors were landing on outdated URLs or the homepage instead of the intended Books section.  
This created unnecessary friction for new visitors who expected to see specific book-related content after clicking a pin.

**Link Strategy and Redirects**  
- Audited all Pinterest backlinks using SEMrush to identify broken or outdated URLs.  
- Created targeted 301 redirects in Squarespace to send old Pinterest pins to the correct live pages.  
- Added anchor links so homepage buttons would jump directly to book sections rather than the top of the page.

**UX Copy and Metadata Improvements**  
- Updated SEO titles and descriptions for Pinterest-driven pages to match user intent.  
- Added short, action-oriented button copy such as “See All Books” and “Read the Poems.”  
- Strengthened page-level metadata to make link previews on Pinterest more meaningful and visually consistent.

**Accessibility and Validation**  
- Verified redirect paths and anchor links for keyboard and screen-reader usability.  
- Retested metadata with Google’s Rich Results Test and Pinterest link previews to confirm accurate titles and images.
