# Pinterest Journey & Discovery Flow

**Role:** UX Content Designer · Content Strategist  
**Platform:** Pinterest (Creator Tools & Analytics)  
**Project Type:** Live Experimentation and Content Optimization  

---

## Objective
Analyze and improve how readers and pinners discover and engage with creative, empowering content across themed boards (Birthday Poems, Girl Power Art, and Seasonal Designs).  
The goal was to refine titles, descriptions, and visual hierarchy to increase saves, improve clarity, and strengthen the connection between Pinterest and the author’s main website.

## Process and Contributions
- **Discovery:** Studied performance analytics to identify which pins (Birthday vs. Halloween vs. Quote boards) drove engagement and profile visits.  
- **Content Testing:** Iteratively tested word choices, hashtags, and image-text balance.  
  - Compared “Happy Birthday Forever” vs. “Birthday Poems That Hit Different.”  
  - Observed that conversational, emotionally clear titles performed better than poetic phrasing.  
- **Design Refinement:** Adjusted font weight, background gray levels, and image composition for legibility and tone.  
- **UX Journey Mapping:** Documented the flow from discovery → pin click → site visit → user action (e.g., reading, saving, or following).  
- **Accessibility & SEO:** Added alt text, simplified anchor text, and unified color treatments across boards for visual consistency.

## Outcome
- Improved discoverability and clarity across boards.  
- Increased understanding of Pinterest’s creator-side UX and the behavioral patterns of readers vs. pinners.  
- Insights contributed directly to how website content was structured and described (as seen in *Penelope’s Secret Pages* and the Books page redesign).

## Reflection
This project showed how even small UX copy and visual hierarchy adjustments can meaningfully influence engagement. It also demonstrated how testing tone and structure in real user environments (like Pinterest) can inform broader content design decisions.
