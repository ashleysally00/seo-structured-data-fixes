# Pinterest Journey & Discovery Flow

**Role:** UX Content Designer · Content Strategist  
**Platform:** Pinterest (Creator Tools & Analytics)  
**Project Type:** Live Experimentation and Content Optimization

## Objective
Analyze and improve how readers and pinners discover and engage with creative, empowering content across themed boards (Birthday Poems, Girl Power Art, and Seasonal Designs).  
The goal was to refine titles, descriptions, and visual hierarchy to increase saves, improve clarity, and strengthen the connection between Pinterest and the author’s main website.

## Process and Contributions

- **Discovery:** Studied performance analytics to identify which pins (Birthday vs. Halloween vs. Quote boards) drove engagement and profile visits.  
- **Content Testing:** Iteratively tested word choices, hashtags, and image-text balance.  
  - Compared “Happy Birthday Forever” vs. “Birthday Poems That Hit Different.”  
  - Observed that conversational, emotionally clear titles performed better than poetic phrasing.  
- **Design Refinement:** Adjusted font weight, background gray levels, and image composition for legibility and tone.  
- **Board Strategy:** Created dedicated Pinterest boards for specific themes like *Birthday Poems* and *Halloween Art*.  
  - The Halloween board mixed my own illustrations and poems with curated pins from other creators to build balance, relevance, and cross-engagement.  
  - This approach encouraged discovery through related visuals while positioning original work alongside trending seasonal art.  
- **UX Journey Mapping:** Documented the flow from discovery → pin click → site visit → user action (e.g., reading, saving, or following).  
- **Accessibility & SEO:** Added alt text, simplified anchor text, and unified color treatments across boards for visual consistency.

## Outcome

### Pinterest Performance
- During the first week of testing, several redesigned pins showed strong early performance:
  - One Halloween pin increased saves by **800%**
  - A birthday pin rose by **500%**
  - Another post gained **107%** more impressions compared to its previous version  
- These early metrics highlighted how clearer wording, improved composition, and more consistent tone could directly influence engagement.  
- Future iterations will track whether these gains hold over time and across additional boards.

### Website Impact
- Following the Pinterest content and SEO updates, Squarespace analytics showed:
  - **311 unique visitors**, a **+90% month-over-month increase**
  - **450 total visits**, a **+40% month-over-month increase**
- These metrics indicate that clearer Pinterest-to-website pathways and more consistent messaging helped attract new readers and returning visitors.

## Reflection
This project showed how even small UX copy and visual hierarchy adjustments can meaningfully influence engagement. It also demonstrated how testing tone and structure in real user environments (like Pinterest) can inform broader content design decisions.
